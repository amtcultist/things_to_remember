Creational Design Pattern
=========================

## Factory method

### Definition
* Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide class to instantiate
* Defining a virtual constructor, since it will create instances not by using a normal constructor (new keyword) but a method

### Example of a factory method:
```ts
function createBMWCar(): Car {
  car: Car = new Car();
  car.name = "BMW";
  car.doStuff = () => {
    console.log("im rich");
  };
  return car;
}
```

While the above example give us a cliche view of a factory method, the definition did tell us how factory method design pattern will benefit subclasses writing style -
through abstraction and polymorphism

### Factory method withing OOP context - subclasses

We have this nice constructor of a car factory - and different car brands

```
Car -> BMW 
    -> Audi
    -> Lamborghini
```
To be honest, if we ***KNEW*** there only 3 subclasses of car, we probably won't need to apply factory methods <br/><br/>

However, life is not simple, so are BAs and POs. If my worklife balancing is a game quest, they must be that impossible boss you died 69420 time before get over in darksoul. <br/><br/>

Anyway, since we don't know and won't sure that there only 3 subclasses, we create a factory method within the base class to ***STANDARIZE*** the architechture model. <br/><br/>

### Example of factory method in Base class
We have these three subclasses
```ts
class BMW {
  constructor() {}
  
  honk() {
    console.log('BMW');
  }
}
```

```ts
class Audi {
  constructor() {}
  
  honk() {
    console.log('Audi');
  }
}
```

```ts
class Lamborghini {
  constructor() {}
  
  honk() {
    console.log('Lamborghini');
  }
}
```

Below is an example of that juicy factory class in base class Car, with options provided for subclasses (BMW, Audi and Lamborghini) with the help of our old reliable friend Enum
```ts
class Car {
  createCar(carType: CarEnum) {
    switch (carType) {
      case CarEnum.BMW:
        return new BMW();
      case CarEnum.LAMBORGHINI:
        return new Lamborghini();
      case CarEnum.Audi:
        return new Audi();
      // TODO add more car
      default:
        throw new Error("Illegal car");
    }
  }
}
```

So for example, when we call a car like this
```ts
  @Inject(Car) car
  const currentCar = car.createCar(CarEnum.BMW);
  currentCar.honk();
```
While the output in this case is 'BMW', we can simply change the CarEnum value and get another subclass instantiate. How simple is that!



## TLDR
* Factory method design pattern provides a way for creating objects in the base class but also allow subclasses options to choose the type of objects to instantiate.
* The `new` keyword is a no-no in this case. There is a difference between requesting an object and creating a new one.
Since the `new` operator ***ALWAYS*** creates an object, it will fail to encapsulate object creation! Factory Method, on the other hand, enforces that sweet encapsulation for us,
and allows an object to be requested without create another one.
## Extra info within Factory Method
* One of the advantage of a Factory Method is that it can be customizable easy. You can return the same instance multiple times (like a singleton) by saving the instance within base class, or can return a subclass rather than an object<br/>

Example of return absolute singletons by saving
```ts
class Car {
  // Singletons variable
  private bmw: BMW;
  private lamborghini: Lamborghini;
  private audi: Audi;
  
  createCar(carType: CarEnum) {
    switch (carType) {
      case CarEnum.BMW:
        return this.bmw ?? new BMW();
      case CarEnum.LAMBORGHINI:
        return this.lamborghini ?? new Lamborghini();
      case CarEnum.Audi:
        return this.audi ?? new Audi();
      // TODO add more car
      default:
        throw new Error("Illegal car");
    }
  }
}
```

Example of returning subclass
```ts
class Car {
  createCar(carType: CarEnum) {
    switch (carType) {
      case CarEnum.BMW:
        return BMW; <- subclass
      case CarEnum.LAMBORGHINI:
        return Lamborghini 
      case CarEnum.Audi:
        return Audi;
      // TODO add more car
      default:
        throw new Error("Illegal car");
    }
  }
}
```
To be honest, since JS treated ***EVERYTHING*** as object (so are subclasses), it is easy to return like this.
* Some recommend that when using Factory Method, absolute all constructors should be private or protected. This, is a matter of how programming languages handle classes (and style, of course).
You should research what's best when designing your projects.

### When to use Factory Method
* When you donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.
* When you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components.
* When you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time.

## Extra usage info (require other Design Patterns knowledge)
* Abstract Factory (another design patterns) classes often implemented Factory Methods, but they can be implemented using Prototype.
* Factory Methods are usually called within Template Methods.
* Factory Method: creation through inheritance. Prototype: creation through delegation.
* Common design practice: Factory Method (simple, customizable, subclasses proliferate) -> Abstract Factory -> Prototype -> Builder (more flexible, more complex) if more flexibility is required.
* Prototype doesn't require subclassing, but it does require an initialize operation. Factory Method requires subclassing, but doesn't require initialize (since it will initialize within the factory)
